To test the function for gathering customer information and ensure that blank lines were not entered, I created a series of automated tests that simulate user input. These tests used predefined input files containing both valid and invalid data. Specifically, the input files included empty lines and spaces to mimic scenarios where users might press Enter without providing any data. The function was then executed, and assertions were made to check if the resulting structure contained valid data. If the input was invalid, the function was expected to prompt the user again until valid input was provided.
To verify that the correct prompts were issued for blank lines, beyond the scope of this workshop, one could use techniques such as output capturing and comparison. This involves redirecting the standard output to a buffer during the test run, capturing the prompts generated by the program, and then comparing the captured output against expected prompt strings. This method would ensure that the program is producing the correct prompts when invalid input is encountered, thereby validating that the user experience is as intended.
